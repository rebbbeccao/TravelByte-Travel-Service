--------------------------------------------------------

Our first group project, which was to combine all the knowledge from the previous 7 weeks into making a functional web app.

TravelByte was developed by us as an application that would help people get more information about destinations they would travel to.
This information is pulled from multiple API's then dynamcially displayed on screen.
